# Great Bay Auction

## Description
This application was constructed as an environment where users can both post and bid on items in an auction environment. All data is stored in a MySQL database and the user interactions are facilitated through the use of the inquirer module. In order to display data to the user in an easily readable format, I also made use of the console.table module. 

## Technologies
* Node.js
* MySQL
* Inquirer
* Console.table

## Future Development
In order to allow users greater interactivity with their data, I would like to include functions that will allow them to remove posts from their history, view all active auctions in which they are the highest bidder, search the database for specific items, and allow administrator access to alter the database as needed.
