# Great Bay Auction

## Description
This application was constructed as an environment where users can both post and bid on items in an auction environment. All data is stored in a MySQL database and the user interactions are facilitated through the use of the inquirer module. In order to display data to the user in an easily readable format, I also made use of the console.table module. 

## Technologies
* Node.js
* MySQL
* Inquirer
* Console.table

## Future Development
In order to refine this application, I would like to set up the ability of certain users to acts as administrators for the database. Additionally, I would like to include better search functionality that would allow the user to more precisely look up information within the database.
